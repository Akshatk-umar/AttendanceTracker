# AttendanceTracker
The Attendance Tracker is a web-based system that allows users to log in, mark their daily attendance, check in and check out, record breaks, view past attendance, and apply for leaves. Admins can manage the entire workflow by reviewing attendance records and approving or rejecting leave requests through a streamlined dashboard.
